# Pipeline development to propose repositionable drugs which increase the functionality of anti-cancer peptides ##

### In this study we inquire the possibility of escalating anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) functionality by diminishing Heparan Sulfate (HS), Heparan Sulfate ProteoGlycans (HSPGs), and Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) branchs at the surface of cancer cells. The reason is that these cell surface components, act as an obstacle on way of ACPs lytic effect #
